Exercises\n","\n","### 1) How can you predict the demand for taxis?\n","\n","Say you work for a taxi company, and you're interested in predicting the demand for taxis.  Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n","- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2016.\n","- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 3 days and the following 3 days, as long as the days fit within the three-month time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 3, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 2 days, the current date, and the following 3 days.\n","\n","This query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.  Note that this query uses a common table expression (CTE); if you need to review how to use CTEs, you're encouraged to check out [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/as-with) in the [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) course."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"8feb4876","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T06:46:03.400879Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T06:46:03.400357Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.518017Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.516853Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.129397,"end_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.520602","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:03.391205","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>trip_date</th>\n","      <th>avg_num_trips</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2016-03-24</td>\n","      <td>86435.714286</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2016-03-18</td>\n","      <td>95345.142857</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2016-03-04</td>\n","      <td>93811.000000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>2016-01-29</td>\n","      <td>79909.857143</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>2016-01-16</td>\n","      <td>84642.285714</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["    trip_date  avg_num_trips\n","0  2016-03-24   86435.714286\n","1  2016-03-18   95345.142857\n","2  2016-03-04   93811.000000\n","3  2016-01-29   79909.857143\n","4  2016-01-16   84642.285714"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/javascript":["parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.3333333333333333, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 2, \"questionId\": \"1_TaxiDemand\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/markdown":["<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Correct</span>"],"text/plain":["Correct"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["# Fill in the blank below\n","avg_num_trips_query = \"\"\"\n","                      WITH trips_by_day AS\n","                      (\n","                      SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date,\n","                          COUNT(*) as num_trips\n","                      FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`\n","                      WHERE trip_start_timestamp > '2016-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2016-04-01'\n","                      GROUP BY trip_date\n","                      )\n","                      SELECT trip_date,\n","                          AVG(num_trips) \n","                          OVER (\n","                               ORDER BY trip_date\n","                               ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING\n","                               ) AS avg_num_trips\n","                      FROM trips_by_day\n","                      \"\"\"\n","\n","# Check your answer\n","q_1.check()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"aafdc30d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.539702Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.538497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.54371Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.542755Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.017208,"end_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.545971","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.528763","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n","#q_1.hint()\n","#q_1.solution()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"db01c9cd","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007728,"end_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.563808","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-19T06:46:04.55608","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### 2) Can you separate and order trips by community area?\n","\n","The query below returns a DataFrame with three columns from the table: `pickup_community_area`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`.  \n","\n","Amend the query to return an additional column called `trip_number` which shows the order in which the trips were taken from their respective community areas.
